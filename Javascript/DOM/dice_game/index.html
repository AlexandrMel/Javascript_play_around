                    <h3>Game History</h3>
                    <hr><br>
                    <p>Pig is a simple dice game first described in print by John Scarne in 1945. As with many games of
                        folk origin, Pig is played with many rule variations. Pig is commonly used by mathematics
                        teachers to teach probability
                        concepts.

                        Pig is one of a family of dice games described by Reiner Knizia as "jeopardy dice games". For
                        jeopardy dice games, the dominant type of decision is whether or not to jeopardize previous
                        gains by
                        rolling for potential greater gains. Most jeopardy dice games can be further subdivided into two
                        categories: jeopardy race games and jeopardy approach games. In jeopardy race games, the object
                        is
                        to be the first to meet or exceed a goal score. In jeopardy approach games, the object is to
                        most closely approach a goal score without
                        exceeding it.

                    <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                    <hr><br>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls two dices until either a 1 is rolled or the player
                            decides to "hold".</li>

                        <li>If the first player rolls at least one 1, they score nothing and the turn goes to the second
                            player.</li>
                        <li>If neither dice faces shows a 1, the dice score is added to their turn total and the
                            player's turn
                            continues.</li>
                        <li>If two 1s are rolled, the playerâ€™s entire score is lost, and the turn ends.</li>
                        <li>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their final score, and it
                            becomes
                            the next
                            player's turn.</li>
                        <li>The first player to score more points then the set Winning Limit, wins.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        For example, the first player, Donald, begins a turn with a roll of 5 and 3. Donald could hold
                        and
                        score 8
                        points, but chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 2 and a 6, and could hold with a turn total of
                        16
                        points, but
                        chooses to roll again. Donald rolls a 1, and must end his turn without scoring. The next player,
                        Alexis,
                        rolls the sequence (4,1)-(5,2)-(3,3), after which she chooses to hold, and adds her turn total
                        of 18
                        points to
                        her score.</p>
